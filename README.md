# Coin_Change_Problem1

Example 1
Input: V=20, coins[]={5,10,10}

Output: 2

Explanation: We see that value of 20 is required. Now, on traversing the coins array, we have the following options:

4 coins of $5 each, ∴Total Coins=4
2 coins of $5 & 1 coin of $10, ∴Total Coins=3
2 coins of $10, ∴Total Coins=2
